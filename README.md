# Red Bank - A Blood Bank Management System
## Project Synopsis
As we know, a blood bank plays a very important role in treatments of major injuries or surgeries. If blood is not supplied to a patient within a set period of time, the patient's chances of losing their lives increases dramatically. It is also obvious that conventional blood bank systems have a lot of disadvantages, they are quite time-consuming, error-prone and also lack in data-integrity. To overcome these problems, the project Blood Bank Management System is proposed. 

*This project follows a hypothetical example of a blood bank named Red Bank, which is a charitable chain of blood banks with branches all over India.* 
Red Bank has built an interactive and simple to use web application for day to day users and hosted it on the **Microsoft Azure** platform. This application maintains information of both blood banks, hospitals and donors, which makes the entire process of blood transfusion easier. 

It enable users to easily check availability of different blood types and also locate the nearest branches. They can also request a specific blood type easily and can also register themselves as donors. Donors can check for Blood camps and hospitals for blood banks and will be getting notifications in case of emergency.
